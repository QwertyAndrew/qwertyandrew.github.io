# Guess Dat Pokemon

A small web-based video game where you gotta guess dat Pokemon! It fetched all existed Pokemons using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co), and then randomly selected one of them for players to guess, just like that one bumper in the official Pokemon Anime series "Who's that Pokemon"!

However, it's not mobile compatible, yet, sadly.

## Installation

It's a web-game, so no need for installation!

But if you really want to use the file manually, do not be afraid, all vanilla codes!

Only PokeAPI is used for this project, but the rest it's all pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You can either clone this project, or you can download the zip file manually.

And then open the index.html via LiveServer plugin from Visual Studio Code, you are good to go!

## How to play

1. Click the "Play" button to start the game.
2. Use the provided input fields to guess the name of the Pokemon based on its blurred image.
3. If your guess is correct, your score will increase, and a new blurry Pokemon image will be displayed.
4. If you guess incorrectly, you'll lose an attempt. Soo, try to guess as many Pokemon as you can before running out of attempts.
5. When you've correctly guessed all Pokemon (wow you are THAT determined), you'll be taken to the win screen, where you can see your final score, verdicts, and gradings!
6. If you are out of attempts, too bad it's game over. You'll be taken to the lose screen, where you can see statistic just like the win screen.
7. Don't forget to have fun, duh.
