# This is C.A.T

Totally a real company, this company is showing their product using ThreeJS!

## Installation

Either you cloned it or just [click here](https://i522562.hera.fontysict.net/thisiscat/)!

FYI, this is not vanilla code, I use ThreeJS, which it use NodeJS, I think.

## Usage

3dModel folder contains, well, 3D models.

Font folder contains 2 main fonts for this website, Bungee and Oxygen.

Image folder contains the logo of the company, as well as Favicon, that's it.

node_modules folder generated when I tried to install ThreeJS, so yeah a bunch of modules are in there.

.gitignore file, I'm not even sure if it works or not.

Index file is the main web page.

package-lock and package.json, no clue, was installed when I tried to install ThreeJS.

Readme file is this, hello!

Script.js file is a JavaScript file to make this website "functionable" in a cool way.

Last but not least, style.css is just the main css file for this web page.
