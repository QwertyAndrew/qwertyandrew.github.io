# YetAnotherSnake.js

A small web-based snake game! That's it lol.

## Installation

It's a web-game, no need for installation!

But if you really want to use the file manually, its all vanilla codes so no worries!

You can either clone this project, or you can download the zip file manually.

## How to play

1. Click the "Play" button to start the game.
2. Choose your game difficulty.
3. Start playing by pressing arrow keys.
4. If you choose normal modes, then try to get the final score, which you can see on top of your screen.
5. If you choose Endless, try to survive as long as possible!
6. Have fun.
